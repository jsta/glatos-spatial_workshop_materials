{: .prereq}

Starting with this episode, we will be moving from working with vector
data to working with raster data. In this episode, we will introduce the
fundamental principles, packages and metadata/raster attributes that are needed
to work with raster data in R. We will discuss some of the core metadata
elements that we need to understand to work with rasters in R, including CRS
and resolution. We will also explore missing and bad data values as stored in a
raster and how R handles these elements.

We will continue to work with the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages that were introduced
in the [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/) lesson. We will use two additional packages in this episode to work with raster data - the
`raster` and `rgdal` packages. Make sure that you have these packages loaded.

## View Raster File Attributes

We will be working with a series of GeoTIFF files in this lesson. The
GeoTIFF format contains a set of embedded tags with metadata about the raster
data. We can use the function `GDALinfo()` to get information about our raster
data before we read that data into R. It is ideal to do this before importing
your data.


~~~
GDALinfo("data/erie_bathy.tif")
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
{: .output}

If you wish to store this information in R, you can do the following:


~~~
erie_bathy_info <- capture.output(
  GDALinfo("data/erie_bathy.tif")
)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Each line of text that was printed to the console is now stored as an element of
the character vector `erie_bathy_info`. We will be exploring this data throughout this 
episode. By the end of this episode, you will be able to explain and understand the output above.

## Open a Raster in R

Now that we've previewed the metadata for our GeoTIFF, let's import this
raster dataset into R and explore its metadata more closely. We can use the `raster()` 
function to open a raster in R.

> ## Data Tip - Object names
> To improve code
> readability, file and object names should be used that make it clear what is in
> the file. The data for this episode were collected from Lake Erie so
> we'll use a naming convention of `datatype_HARV`.
{: .callout}

First we will load our raster file into R and view the data structure.


~~~
erie_bathy <- raster("data/erie_bathy.tif")

erie_bathy
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

values     : -62.47671, 598.1871  (min, max)
~~~
{: .output}

The information above includes a report of min and max values, but no other data
range statistics. Similar to other R data structures like vectors and data frame
columns, descriptive statistics for raster data can be retrieved like


~~~
summary(erie_bathy)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning in .local(object, ...): summary is an estimate based on a sample of 1e+05 cells (8.71% of all cells)
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
        erie_bathy

Median   63.313280
3rd Qu. 219.961578
Max.    596.867676
NA's      0.000000
~~~
{: .output}

but note the warning - unless you force R to calculate these statistics using
every cell in the raster, it will take a random sample of 100,000 cells and
calculate from that instead. To force calculation on more, or even all values,
you can use the parameter `maxsamp`:


~~~
summary(erie_bathy, maxsamp = ncell(erie_bathy))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
         erie_bathy
Min.      -62.47671
1st Qu.     1.49860
Median     63.22672
3rd Qu.   220.23468
Max.      598.18713
NA's    64779.00000
~~~
{: .output}

You may not see major differences in summary stats as `maxsamp` increases,
except with very large rasters.

To visualise this data in R using `ggplot2`, we need to convert it to a
dataframe. We learned about dataframes in [an earlier
lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/04-data-structures-part2/index.html).
The `raster` package has an built-in function for conversion to a plotable dataframe.


~~~
erie_bathy_df <- as.data.frame(erie_bathy, xy = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now when we view the structure of our data, we will see a standard
dataframe format.


~~~
str(erie_bathy_df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	1148189 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ x         : num  245839 246115 246391 246667 246943 ...
 $ y         : num  4766903 4766903 4766903 4766903 4766903 ...
 $ erie_bathy: num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can use `ggplot()` to plot this data. We will set the color scale to `scale_fill_viridis_c`
which is a color-blindness friendly color scale. We will also use the `coord_quickmap()` function to use an approximate Mercator projection for our plots. This approximation is suitable for small areas that are not too close to the poles. Other coordinate systems are available in ggplot2 if needed, you can learn about them at their help page `?coord_map`.

This map shows the elevation of our Lake Erie study area. From the
legend, we can see that the maximum elevation is ~600, but we can't tell whether
this is 600 feet or 600 meters because the legend doesn't show us the units. We
can look at the metadata of our object to see what the units are. Much of the
metadata that we're interested in is part of the CRS. We introduced the
concept of a CRS in [an earlier
lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs).

Now we will see how features of the CRS appear in our data file and what
meanings they have.

### View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in R
We can view the CRS string associated with our R object using the`crs()`
function.


~~~
crs(erie_bathy)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
CRS arguments:
 +proj=utm +zone=17 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m

~~~
{: .output}

> ## Challenge
> What units are our data in?
>
> > ## Answers
> > `+units=m` tells us that our data is in meters.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Understanding CRS in Proj4 Format
The CRS for our data is given to us by R in `proj4` format. Let's break down
the pieces of `proj4` string. The string contains all of the individual CRS
elements that R or another GIS might need. Each element is specified with a
`+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by a `,`. After
each `+` we see the CRS element being defined. For example projection (`proj=`)
and zone (`zone=`).

### UTM Proj4 String
Our projection string for `erie_bathy` specifies the UTM projection as follows:

`+proj=utm +zone=17 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs`

* **proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
* **zone=17:** the zone is 17
* **ellps=GRS80:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for
the data is GRS80
* **towgs84:** transformations required to align to 0,0 reference coordinate system used in the projection
* **units=m:** the units for the horizontal coordinates are in meters

Note that the zone is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRSs will have a
zone. Image source: Chrismurf at English Wikipedia, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#/media/File:Utm-zones-USA.svg) (CC-BY).

## Calculate Raster Min and Max Values

It is useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. In this
case, given we are working with elevation data, these values represent the
min/max elevation range at our site.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a GeoTIFF for us. We
can view these values:


~~~
minValue(erie_bathy)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -62.47671
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
maxValue(erie_bathy)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 598.1871
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Data Tip - Set min and max values
> If the minimum and maximum values haven't already been
> calculated, we can calculate them using the
> `setMinMax()` function.
>
> 
> ~~~
> erie_bathy <- setMinMax(erie_bathy)
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
{: .callout}

We can see that the elevation at our site ranges from -62.4767075m to
598.1871338m.

## Raster Bands
The Digital Surface Model object (`erie_bathy`) that we've been working with is a
single band raster. This means that there is only one dataset stored in the
raster: surface elevation in meters for one time period.

![Multi-band raster image](../images/dc-spatial-raster/single_multi_raster.png)

A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the `raster()`
function to import one single band from a single or multi-band raster. We can
view the number of bands in a raster using the `nlayers()` function.


~~~
nlayers(erie_bathy)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}

However, raster data can also be multi-band, meaning that one raster file
contains data for more than one variable or time period for each cell. By
default the `raster()` function only imports the first band in a raster
regardless of whether it has one or more bands. Jump to a later episode in
this series for information on working with multi-band rasters:
[Work with Multi-band Rasters in R]({{ site.baseurl }}/05-raster-multi-band-in-r/).

## Dealing with Missing Data

Raster data often has a `NoDataValue` associated with it. This is a value
assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected.

By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we have  a dataset
that has a shape that isn't rectangular, some pixels at the edge of the raster
will have `NoDataValue`s. This can happen if the data were collected by an
airplane which only flew over some part of a defined region.

In the image below, no pixels are black meaning we have data for every raster "cell".

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-demonstrate-no-data-black-ggplot-1.png" title="plot of chunk demonstrate-no-data-black-ggplot" alt="plot of chunk demonstrate-no-data-black-ggplot" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If your raster has `NA` values but you aren't sure where they are, you can deliberately plot them in a particular colour. This can be useful when checking a dataset's coverage. For instance, sometimes data can be missing where a sensor could not 'see' its target data, and you may wish to locate that missing data and fill it in.

To highlight `NA` values in ggplot, alter the `scale_fill_*()` layer to contain a colour instruction for `NA` values, like `scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = 'deeppink')`

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-napink-1.png" title="plot of chunk napink" alt="plot of chunk napink" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The value that is conventionally used to take note of missing data (the
`NoDataValue` value) varies by the raster data type. For floating-point rasters,
the figure `-3.4e+38` is a common default, and for integers, `-9999` is
common. Some disciplines have specific conventions that vary from these
common values.

In some cases, other `NA` values may be more appropriate. An `NA` value should
be a) outside the range of valid values, and b) a value that fits the data type
in use. For instance, if your data ranges continuously from -20 to 100, 0 is
not an acceptable `NA` value! Or, for categories that number 1-15, 0 might be
fine for `NA`, but using -.000003 will force you to save the GeoTIFF on disk
as a floating point raster, resulting in a bigger file.

If we are lucky, our GeoTIFF file has a tag that tells us what is the
`NoDataValue`. If we are less lucky, we can find that information in the
raster's metadata. If a `NoDataValue` was stored in the GeoTIFF tag, when R
opens up the raster, it will assign each instance of the value to `NA`. Values
of `NA` will be ignored by R as demonstrated above.

## Bad Data Values in Rasters

Bad data values are different from `NoDataValue`s. Bad data values are values
that fall outside of the applicable range of a dataset.

Examples of Bad Data Values:

* The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a measure of
greenness, has a valid range of -1 to 1. Any value outside of that range would
be considered a "bad" or miscalculated value.
* Reflectance data in an image will often range from 0-1 or 0-10,000 depending
upon how the data are scaled. Thus a value greater than 1 or greater than 10,000
is likely caused by an error in either data collection or processing.

### Find Bad Data Values
Sometimes a raster's metadata will tell us the range of expected values for a
raster. Values outside of this range are suspect and we need to consider that
when we analyze the data. Sometimes, we need to use some common sense and
scientific insight as we examine the data - just as we would for field data to
identify questionable values.

Plotting data with appropriate highlighting can help reveal patterns in bad
values and may suggest a solution. Below, reclassification is used to highlight
elevation values less than 0m with a contrasting colour.

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-demo-bad-data-highlighting-1.png" title="plot of chunk demo-bad-data-highlighting" alt="plot of chunk demo-bad-data-highlighting" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Create A Histogram of Raster Values

We can explore the distribution of values contained within our raster using the
`geom_histogram()` function which produces a histogram. Histograms are often
useful in identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data.


~~~
ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = erie_bathy_df, aes(erie_bathy))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
Warning: Removed 64779 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
~~~
{: .error}

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-view-raster-histogram-1.png" title="plot of chunk view-raster-histogram" alt="plot of chunk view-raster-histogram" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notice that a warning message is thrown when R creates the histogram.

`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

This warning is caused by a default setting in `geom_histogram` enforcing that there are
30 bins for the data. We can define the number of bins we want in the histogram
by using the `bins` value in the `geom_histogram()` function.



~~~
ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = erie_bathy_df, aes(erie_bathy), bins = 40)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning: Removed 64779 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
~~~
{: .error}

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-view-raster-histogram2-1.png" title="plot of chunk view-raster-histogram2" alt="plot of chunk view-raster-histogram2" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the shape of this histogram looks similar to the previous one that
was created using the default of 30 bins. The distribution of elevation values
for our Bathymetry data looks reasonable. It is likely there are
no bad data values in this particular raster.
