{: .prereq}

In this episode, we will introduce the fundamental principles, packages and
metadata attributes that are needed to work with vector data in R. We will open
and plot point, line and polygon vector data stored in shapefile format in R.
In later episodes, we will learn how to work with raster and vector data
together and combine them into a single plot.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `sf` package to work with vector data in R. Notice that the
`rgdal` package automatically loads when `sf` is loaded. We will also use the
`raster` package, which we will work with in more detail in later episodes, so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands. Make sure you have the `sf` library loaded. 

```{r load-sf, results='hide', eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(sf)
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing the outline of Lake Erie
* A line shapefile representing bathymetry contours

The first shapefile that we will open contains the outline of Lake Erie. To
import shapefiles we use the `sf` function `st_read()`. `st_read()` requires
the file path to the shapefile.

Let's import our outline:

```{r Import-Shapefile}
erie_outline <- st_read(
  "data/erie_outline.shp")
```

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `Lake_Erie_Shoreline` shapefile layer into R (as our
`erie_outline` object), the `st_read()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
metadata, describing the format, CRS, extent, and other components of
the vector data, and the attributes which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object.

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (i.e. geographic area that the shapefile covers) of
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the combined
extent for all spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `st_geometry_type()`, `st_crs()` and 
`st_bbox()` functions. First, let's view the geometry type for our outline 
shapefile: 

```{r}
st_geometry_type(erie_outline)
```

Our `erie_outline` is a polygon object. The 18 levels shown below
our output list the possible categories of the geometry type. 
Now let's check what CRS this file data is in:

```{r}
st_crs(erie_outline)
```

Our data in the CRS **UTM zone 17N**. The CRS is critical to 
interpreting the object's extent values as it specifies units. To find
the extent of our outline, we can use the `st_bbox()` function: 

```{r}
st_bbox(erie_outline)
```

The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

Lastly, we can view all of the metadata and attributes for this shapefile object
by printing it to the screen:

```{r}
erie_outline
```

## Spatial Data Attributes
Now we will explore how to use spatial data attributes stored in our data to 
plot different features.

## Plot a Shapefile

Let's visualize the data in our `sf` object using the `ggplot` package. Unlike 
with raster data, we do not need to convert vector data to a dataframe before 
plotting with `ggplot`. 

We're going to customize our boundary plot by setting the size, color, and fill 
for our plot. When plotting `sf` objects with `ggplot2`, you do not need to use 
the `coord_sf()` coordinate system.

```{r plot-shapefile, fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = erie_outline, size = 1.5, color = "black", fill = "cyan1") + 
  ggtitle("Lake Erie Outline") + 
  coord_sf()
```
